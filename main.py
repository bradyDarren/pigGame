# This program is used to create a game called pig where the objective is to reach a score of 100.
# through the sum of the rolls you have made. You can either select to stop rolling and safely take
# your points or continue to roll in effort to obtain the score of 100 or higher to win the game.
# If you happen to roll a 1 the all the point that you have previously scored will now be 0.
